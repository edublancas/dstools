# FIXME: restrict for now TaskGroup treated as a single task to be a source
# node, otherwise handling the upstream logic becomes messy:
# the dag.plot function should see a single edge but in reality there should
# be many going from the upstream dependencies to each one of the tasks
# in the group, currently plotting and execution have the same source of truth:
# the nx.DiGraph object so we will have to make some changes - probably
# just at the plot level: the DAG should still see edges to all the subtasks
# for execution to run successfully but the plot function should only
# draw a single circle


# FIXME: behavior is very different when treat_as_single_task is on,
# better to make it to separate classes (they should not subclass from Task
# though) - TaskGroup as multuple tasks definitely no, since it is just a proxy
# for adding many tasks to a dag, for the other case, seems like we will have
# to override most of the methods anyway and subclassing will make this
# complex, better just to implement whatever methods are needed and disclose
# whih Task-like behavior does not work
