        Use the model from a previous experiment to predict on one of the
        existing feature schemas.

        The function unpickles the model, scaler and imputer. Then, gets
        the features the model was trained on from MongoDB, loads the features
        from the PostgresSQL schema and predicts.

        For pickles to exist, use the --pickle option in model.py

        Example:
        model_id = '56ccea5ae0f48ce44f618afe'
        schema = 'features_field_test_31dec2014'
        df = predict_on_schema(model_id, schema)
